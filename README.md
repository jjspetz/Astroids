This was a successful attempt to port a pygame to HTML canvas using javascript.

### Technology Used
Javascript and minimal HTML/CSS

### Challenges Faced
The original PyGame version was heavily dependent on using python objects.
Javascript objects function a bit differently so understanding these differences was key to
implementing this game in javascript.

### Going Forward
1. I would like to make the game mobile friendly.
2. I would like to include more complicated sprites so I can add rotation into the game.
3. I would like to add a shooting and thrust mechanic.
